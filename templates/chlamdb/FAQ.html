        <div class="content-FAQ">
          Since this database is capable of several analyses and ideally it would be enirched with additional ones we consider the name "The DataBase" a proper one. ZDB is the abbreviation of how french people would pronunce TheDB: zeDéBé.

                    <div class="content-FAQ">
                      <p>Comparative_db  consists of two parts:
                        <br>1. generation of a SQL database through a Nextflow–based pipeline applied on two or more input .gbk files.
                        <br>2. launch of an overview and interacting webpage that displays the results retrieved in step 1.</p>

                    <div class="content-FAQ">
                      <p> Standard Genbank file that contains genome sequences and annotations.
                        <br>Only the extention <b>“.gbk”</b> is used, consequently Genbank files downloaded from NCBI, with the extention “.gbff” must be renamed as “.gbk”.
                        <br>You can annotate a genome and generate the corresponding “.gbk” file using <a href="https://github.com/tseemann/prokka"> Prokka </a> .

                    <button type="button" class="collapsible_FAQ">-How do I identify which proteins are part of a specific orthogroup?</button>
                    <div class="content-FAQ">
                      There are several ways to do so. The easiest is searching the name of the orthogroup of interest in the search bar, alternatively links to Orthogroup pages are provided once you click on a genome of the list present in "Genomes".                  
                    </div>  
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible_FAQ">- How many sequence can I blast? </button>
                    <div class="content-FAQ">
                        You can blast only one sequence (both protein or nucleotide) at a time against the genomes of the database.

                    <button type="button" class="collapsible_FAQ">-How do I use the search bar? </button>
                    <div class="content-FAQ">
                      The search bar can be used to search any term into the datbase. For example it is possible to access a cog, a kegg or an accession term directly typing it in the searchbar.                      
                    </div>  
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible_FAQ">-Are the kegg maps modified according to the selected genome? </button>
                    <div class="content-FAQ">
                      Yes, they are. You can visualize which genes of each metabolic map are carried by a genome of interest.
                    </div> 
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible_FAQ">-How do I extract metabolic information? </button>
                    <div class="content-FAQ">
                         <br>In the section "Analyses" of the side menu, in the subsection called "Metabolism", you can select 'kegg modules' and investigate a specific KEGG category of interest (example: Energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, etc). Within the category,for each gneome you can visualize the KEGG modules and the ko entries that belong to each module. Besides, you can list the proteins, annotated with ko identifiers further linked to the Ko database, that belong to a selected Kegg module and navigate to the protein locus. This analysis let you navigate from a global kegg characterization of your genomes to a more detailed description of each kegg-described protein.
                         <br>A phylogenetic tree annotated with the presence/absence and quantification of the genes which belong to each KO entry is available (a single entry or all the entries together can be visualized).
                         In addition, you can compare the strains and have an easy-readable table that reports all the ko modules and the number of proteins that belongs to each one.

                    <button type="button" class="collapsible_FAQ">How can I perform a comparative analysis?</button>
                    <div class="content-FAQ">
                      In the section "Analyses" of the side menu, in the subsection called “Comparison” you perform comparative analyses on orthogroups, COGs, Kegg Orthologs or Pfam domains (options displayed according to your selections). For example, selecting the Kegg Orthologs anlysis you can compare two or more genomes and idenfity which KO entries have in common (you can also exclude those which belong to other genome(s)) and visualize the result in a Venn diagram. For each Ko entry you can investigate  which pathway and module it is part of, how many proteins are associated with it and of which orthogroup(s) they are part. IN this case discrepencies between orthogroup clustering and ko prediction are higlighted in the phylogentic tree.                     </div>
